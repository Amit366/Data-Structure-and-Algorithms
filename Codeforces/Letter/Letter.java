/*
Vasya decided to write an anonymous letter cutting the letters out of a newspaper heading. He knows heading s1 and text s2 that he wants to send. 
Vasya can use every single heading letter no more than once. Vasya doesn't have to cut the spaces out of the heading â€” he just leaves some blank
 space to mark them. Help him; find out if he will manage to compose the needed text.
